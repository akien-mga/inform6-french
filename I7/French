Understand "porter [something preferably held]" as wearing.

To be checked when the final release of inform 7 will be out...

(edit :)
Because of the impossibility to derive some verbs into Inform 7, it's necessary to shortcut the reference to french verbs into FrenchGN11.h, and define the new relations into this Extension. We'll add new verbs when it's necessary.

[

note : 
blowing' action, intended for woodwind instruments and perhaps the occasional siphon, has been withdrawn from the built-in set: it no longer seems to us part of the essential core of actions. We have similarly removed praying, digging, jumping over, filling and swimming

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Inform 7 ne permet pas actuellement de changer de système de langue comme c'était le cas auparavant. Cependant, il est possible d'utiliser des versions modifiées de nos bibliothèques d'Inform 6 pour composer des jeux avec Inform 7.

Pour l'utiliser, vous utiliserez notre script d'installation disponible sur http://informfr.tuxfamily.org/, ou bien vous pouvez procéder manuellement : Entrer dans le répertoire d'installation d'Inform7, ce répertoire étant : 
	sous windows : C:\Program Files\Inform 7\ 
	sous mac os x : "afficher le contenu du paquet" Inform.app, puis aller dans Contents/Ressources 	(en ligne de commande : /Applications/Inform.app/Contents/Ressources )
	sous linux : /usr/share/gnome-inform7/ ou /usr/local/share/inform7/

ajouter les 3 fichiers FrenchGN11.h, FrenchN11.h et Selector.h dans le dossier Library/Natural/ (là où se trouvent déjà Grammar.h et English.h). 
Ensuite remplacer le contenu de Main.i6 qui se trouve dans Inform7/Extensions/Reserved par le fichier MainFR.i6.

Pour utiliser les bibliothèques françaises, il faudrait inclure dans la source du jeu :

		Include French by Eric Forgeot. 
		Use French Language.

En ayant bien auparavant installé cette extension via la commande >Files>Install extensions d'Inform 7.


Pour information, le fichier inform7/extensions/reserved/Main.i6 est modifié ainsi :

        vers ligne 80 :
        {-open-file}!% +language_name=Selector
        {-call:compile_icl_commands}

        puis 
        
        vers ligne 417 :
        #IFDEF ForeignLanguage;
        #IFNOT;
                Include "Grammar";
        #ENDIF;

        Il faudra le refaire à chaque mise à jour d'Inform7. 


Pour utiliser Inform 7 uniquement en ligne de commande, on peut invoquer le compilateur ni avec :
                ./ni -rules ./Inform7/Extensions -package ./Projects/project.inform -extension=z8
                et le compilateur inform avec :
                ./inform-6.31-biplatform -v8 +language_name=FrenchN11 -wSD +include_path=Projects/project.inform/Build/auto.info project.z8

        

Merci à Sarganar et à l'équipe de Rakontointeraktiva pour l'effort commun de nos traductions en différentes langues.
